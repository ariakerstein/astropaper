Iï»¿ walk outside in the golden dusk. Magnolia buds, red fire against the straw branches and sky. The frogs (peepers) peep in the marshland. We come upon our little patch of this earth. It's a small thing in the grand currents sweeping this human story. But I appreciate it. Greatly. So greatly. It's both tiny and everything. Today I see it as everything. And that perspective itself is pareto optimal. With these kinds of things you usually just know.
