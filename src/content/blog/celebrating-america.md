Yï»¿esterday we took the kids to the 250th anniversary of the battle of Lexington. We are a divided country. And divisions always exist. But let's remember that we generally want the same things - life, liberty, pursuit of happiness, opportunity and so forth. This is the greatest country on earth...but only if we commit to making it so. And this responsibility falls to all of us as citizens. It starts with decency, respect and gratitude for what we have.
