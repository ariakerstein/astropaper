I﻿ look out over the empire state building. I get emotional. The contributions of so many people laid out before me. 

We look out over the freedom tower. The built environment - an ecosystem as magnificent as any natural world. Environments are inevitable extensions of life. It's what we do - we build and make.

O﻿ur ingenuity is a miracle. Consider what it took to make all this. Material science, engineering, dump trucks, rivets, legal documents, mothers. 

We eat an ice cream. 

Humans are incredible. Not just the incredible humans we all worship. No, they are closer to the rest of us than we care to admit. Marvel at their achievements as much for their standalone merits, as that they took essentially the same machinery as you and I have, and made something remarkable with it. We too are capable of such achievements. 

I﻿ feel blessed to have been born a human. It's a rare feeling. And a great one.
