#### Ari Akerstein

I'm an Entrepreneur, Product Manager, Father, Molecular Biologist.
I use this space to keep track of my various thoughts about the world. As a Product manager and leader I think a lot about Product craft, essays and general observations.

#### Some things about me:

- Grew up in Providence, RI
- Invented CoreWheels after college, inspired by gymnastic strength and wanting to give people at home a better way to improve their strength/weight ratio.

- Led various Product or Growth areas at companies like @Walmartlabs, Facebook/Meta, Tophatter, BabyCenter/Johnson&Johnson, IncredibleLabs.
- Live(d) in California (SF, EastBay) for many years. Moved to MA during the pandemic and haven't looked back.
- Battled Cancer in 2018 as a new dad - wrote a lot about that here RoguePatient.
- Decided to pivot my career into healthtech. Joined GrandRounds/Included Health (merged with Doctor On Demand) to build their virtual specialty care product.
- I now lead a healthtech accelerator focused on improving the patient experience relative to hard medical situations e.g., advanced cancer.
